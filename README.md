A [MusicBee](https://www.getmusicbee.com/) plugin that sends information on the currently playing song to the server specified in the configuration.
For now, the configuration must be manually placed in `%appdata%\MusicBee\`. (see `post-public-music-settings.example.json`)

Only really meant to work with [the server I wrote](https://github.com/James-McK/PostPublicMusicReceiver) and probably not useful to anybody else, but it's here just in case! See <https://mck.is/blog/2024/small-projects-for-fun/> for more details.
